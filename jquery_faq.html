    <li>Sometimes it may be seen from the city of Reykjavík over Faxa Bay, at a distance of 120 km.</li>
    <li>The mountain is one of the most famous sites of Iceland, primarily due to the novel Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) by Jules Verne, in which the protagonists find the entrance to a passage leading to the center of the earth on Snæfellsjökull.</li>
